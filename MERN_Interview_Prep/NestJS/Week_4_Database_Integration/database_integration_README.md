## Resources:

- [TypeORM Documentation](https://typeorm.io/)
- [NestJS TypeORM](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database)
- [Mongoose Documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
- [NestJS Mongoose](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mongodb)

## Assignment:

Build a NestJS application that implements both SQL (TypeORM) and NoSQL (Mongoose) databases with proper relationships and queries.
