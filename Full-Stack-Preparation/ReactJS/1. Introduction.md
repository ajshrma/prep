## What is React?

### Definition

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook (now Meta) and a community of individual developers and companies.

### Key Features

- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs
- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: Develop new features without rewriting existing code
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering through a virtual representation of the UI
- **JSX**: Syntactic sugar for React.createElement()
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction from parent to child

### History and Evolution

- 2011: React was created by Jordan Walke at Facebook
- 2012: Used in Facebook's newsfeed
- 2013: Open-sourced at JSConf US
- 2015: React Native released
- 2016: React 15 with improved SVG support
- 2017: React 16 with complete rewrite (Fiber)
- 2019: React 16.8 with Hooks
- 2020: React 17 with gradual upgrades
- 2022: React 18 with concurrent features

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Required Tools

1. **Node.js and npm**

   ```bash
   # Check Node.js version
   node --version

   # Check npm version
   npm --version
   ```

2. **Code Editor (VS Code recommended)**
   Extensions:

   - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
   - Prettier
   - ESLint
   - Auto Import
   - Path Intellisense

3. **Create React App**

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   cd my-app
   npm start
   ```

4. **Browser Extensions**
   - React Developer Tools
   - Redux DevTools

### Project Structure

## Your First React Application

### Basic Component

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react";

function App() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, React!</h1>
			<p>Welcome to your first React application.</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

### Adding State

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Handling Events

```jsx
function Button() {
	const handleClick = (event) => {
		console.log("Button clicked!", event);
	};

	return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Component Organization

- One component per file
- Clear naming conventions
- Logical folder structure
- Component composition

### 2. Code Style

- Use functional components
- Implement proper prop types
- Keep components small
- Follow DRY principle

### 3. Performance

- Use React.memo for optimization
- Implement lazy loading
- Avoid unnecessary renders
- Optimize event handlers

### 4. State Management

- Keep state close to usage
- Use context appropriately
- Consider state libraries
- Implement proper data flow

## Common Pitfalls

1. **State Updates**

   - Mutating state directly
   - Not using setState callback
   - Race conditions
   - Async state updates

2. **Side Effects**

   - Missing dependencies
   - Infinite loops
   - Memory leaks
   - Improper cleanup

3. **Performance**
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Large bundle sizes
   - Unoptimized images
   - Excessive API calls

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Counter Application

Create a counter with increment, decrement, and reset functionality.

```jsx
// Solution
function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(0)}>Reset</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Exercise 2: Todo List

Create a simple todo list with add, remove, and toggle completion features.

### Exercise 3: API Integration

Create a component that fetches and displays data from an API.

## Interview Questions

### Basic Level

1. What is React and why use it?

   ```
   Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used because:
   - Virtual DOM for better performance
   - Component-based architecture
   - Rich ecosystem
   - Strong community support
   ```

2. What is JSX?

   ```
   Answer: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
   It gets transformed into regular JavaScript during build time.
   ```

3. What is the difference between state and props?
   ```
   Answer:
   - Props are read-only and passed from parent to child
   - State is mutable and managed within the component
   - Props are external, state is internal
   ```
